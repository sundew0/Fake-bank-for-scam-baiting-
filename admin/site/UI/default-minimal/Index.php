/*
    DEFAULT THEME - DSJAS
    =====================

    This is the theming files included in the default installation of DSJAS.
    It contains HTML and PHP files required to load and display the default theme.

    This file should never be accessed directly, and instead should only be
    required by a file which has already bootstrapped the site.
    This means that your script must have defined the ABSPATH constants
    and preformed other required bootstrapping tasks before the page
    can be displayed.


    For more information of theming and creating your own themes, please refer to the
    API documentation for themes and plugins.
